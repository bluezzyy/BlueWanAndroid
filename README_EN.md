Thanks for WanAndroid provide those APIs, and thank for all of the outstanding developers for their excellent open source projects!




Everyone is welcome to submit issues, if you think the project is good, I hope to give a Star. thanks for your support




### Why I write this project



Google has launched Jetpack development components for 2 years. Learn how these tools are used, what are the principles behind them, and even what design ideas are worth learning in them, which are useful for improving our coding level and architecture design capabilities. great help. Doing it yourself is the best way to learn.

Many Wanandroid clients are developed using Java language, based on MVP mode, RxJava and other frameworks, so this project also hopes to give students who learn new skills a little help.



### Will this project implement all the functions provided by the API?



No.


Because the project itself is to learn MVVM+Jetpack, and some new technologies, this client currently only implements:

* Home Article

* Knowledge 

* Project




## Milestone

* 2020/06/07 Complete the basic functions of the homepage feature.
* 2020/08/08 Complete the basic functions of the knowledge feature.
